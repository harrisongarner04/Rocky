    <article class="Bio">
      <h2>Apollo Creed: The King of Sting</h2>
      <h3>Early Life and Rise</h3>
      <p>
        Apollo Creed was born in Los Angeles and rose from modest beginnings to
        become one of the most charismatic heavyweight boxers of his time.
        Gifted with speed, power, and intelligence, he combined his athletic
        skill with a flair for promotion. Known for his extravagant entrances
        and larger-than-life persona, he became both a dominant champion and a
        cultural icon.
      </p>
      <h3>Champion of the World</h3>
      <p>
        During his reign as World Heavyweight Champion, Creed built an
        impressive undefeated record. Behind the showmanship was a disciplined
        athlete who trained relentlessly and studied every opponent. His
        confidence and style made him a symbol of ambition and the American
        dream, admired as much for his personality as for his victories in the
        ring.
      </p>
      <h3>Rivalry with Rocky Balboa</h3>
      <p>
        Creed's career reached its turning point when he gave underdog Rocky
        Balboa a chance at the title. What started as a publicity stunt turned
        into a legendary rivalry. Their first fight ended in a close decision
        for Creed, but the rematch saw him lose the championship. Despite the
        defeat, their battles forged a mutual respect that grew into a lasting
        friendship.
      </p>

      <h3>Legacy and Tragedy</h3>
      <p>
        Later, pride led Creed to an exhibition fight with the powerful Soviet
        boxer Ivan Drago. Though past his prime, he entered with his trademark
        showmanship and spirit. The bout ended in tragedy when Creed was fatally
        injured in the ring, leaving the boxing world stunned. His legacy lived
        on through his family and his son, Adonis, who carried forward the Creed
        name and spirit of a champion.
