      <h2>Rocky Balboa: Keep Punching</h2>
      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Robert “Rocky” Balboa was born on July 6, 1945, in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania, to Italian-American parents. Growing up in a working-class
        neighborhood, Rocky struggled academically and socially, often dismissed
        as a “bum” by those around him. Though he lacked formal education, he
        developed a natural toughness and a heart full of determination. His
        early years were marked by odd jobs and street fights, before he found
        his calling in the boxing ring.
      </p>
      <h3>The Struggling Fighter</h3>
      <p>
        In his twenties, Rocky became a small-time club fighter, eking out a
        modest living. Despite his raw power and resilience, he never rose far
        in the ranks. To make ends meet, he worked as a debt collector for a
        loan shark named Gazzo—something that weighed heavily on his conscience.
        Still, he trained in local gyms, never letting go of the faint dream
        that he could be something more.
      </p>
      <h3>The Break of a Lifetime</h3>
      <p>
        In 1976, his life changed forever. The reigning world heavyweight
        champion, Apollo Creed, seeking a publicity stunt, chose Rocky—“The
        Italian Stallion”—as his next opponent. Creed expected an easy fight,
        but Rocky shocked the world by going the distance with the champion.
        Though he lost by decision, his courage and relentless spirit captured
        the hearts of millions.
      </p>

      <h3>Becoming the Champion</h3>
      <p>
        Rocky's rematch with Apollo proved decisive: he won the heavyweight
        championship of the world. His triumph marked the pinnacle of a journey
        from obscurity to glory. Rocky successfully defended his title multiple
        times, cementing his reputation as a true champion. Yet the victories
        were never just about belts or money—they were about dignity,
        perseverance, and proving that heart could overcome odds.
