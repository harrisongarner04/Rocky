    <article class="Bio">
      <h2>Ivan Drago- Death from Above!</h2>
      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Ivan Drago was born in the Soviet Union and trained in the state-run
        sports system from a young age. He was molded into a disciplined and
        physically imposing athlete, with a focus on strength, speed, and
        technique, reflecting the rigorous Soviet approach to producing
        world-class fighters.
      </p>
      <h3>Amateur Career</h3>
      <p>
        Drago had an extraordinary amateur boxing career, reportedly winning
        hundreds of fights. His dominance in the amateur ring earned him a
        reputation as a near-perfect athlete, combining precision, power, and
        stamina, which made him a national sports hero.
      </p>
      <h3>Professional Debut</h3>
      <p>
        Drago's first professional bout was against Apollo Creed, a highly
        anticipated match that ended in tragedy when Apollo was killed in the
        ring. This fight established Drago as an unstoppable force and cemented
        his fearsome reputation in the heavyweight division.
      </p>
      <h3>Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        Known for his imposing size, cold efficiency, and scientific approach to
        training, Drago remains one of the most iconic figures in boxing. His
        combination of raw power and disciplined technique set a benchmark for
        challengers, and his legacy continues to loom large in the sport.
